# Keylogger-with-Screenshot-Capture
Hi friends, in this project, I designed a keylogger in python for educational purposes.
With this keylogger, it is possible to take screenshots periodically and at the same time get the keyboard input from the user.


It automatically saves the information in a file output called Picture in the C directory on a computer.

You can see the screenshots and enter the keyboard in this file.

It simultaneously saves the keyboard input to a txt file named logs.

At the same time, it sends information in the form of a zip file to the e-mail address entered every 5 minutes.
You can see it under the mail function field of the section where you will enter the e-mail address in the codes.
You can contact me for any questions about the project.
