# Keylogger-with-Screenshot-Capture

- Hi friends, in this project, I designed a keylogger in python for educational purposes.
With this keylogger, it is possible to take screenshots periodically and at the same time get the keyboard input from the user.

# Make sure your PIP is up to date
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools

```
